This repository contains my solutions to the Advent of Code 2023 challenges written in Go.

## About Advent of Code

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) is an annual event where participants solve daily programming puzzles, each
released in the form of a two-part challenge. The challenges cover various topics, and participants often use the
opportunity to sharpen their problem-solving and coding skills.

## About My Approach

It was my first Advent of Code. I didn't know that it has two parts per day, so in this repository I have solutions only
for part 2 of every problem.

I was aiming to:

* utilize my knowledge of algorithms and data structures;
* make solutions as general as I could;
* prioritize code readability over how fast I can write the solution â€” I didn't try to compete on global leaderboard.

And I also learned a lot! For example, I learned
about [Shoelace formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoelace_formula) to calculate a polygon area
for [day 18](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/18), I found out [Z3 theorem prover](https://github.com/Z3Prover/z3)
in [day 24](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/24), and I
implemented [Karger's algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karger%27s_algorithm) to find a global minimum cut
for [day 25](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/25).

It was very fun (I got tired at the end, though), and I was very glad that I took part in this event. Huge thanks
to [Eric Wastl](http://was.tl/), the creator of Advent of Code!
